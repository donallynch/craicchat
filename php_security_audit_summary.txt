PHP-FPM Hardening Audit – Automated (ran 2025-11-30)
Overall Score: 94/100 (Elite)

Critical RCE Vectors Blocked:
• disable_functions: 100% of non-essential dangerous functions disabled (curl_exec/assert allowed by design, mitigated)
• allow_url_include: OFF
• expose_php: OFF
• zend.assertions: -1 (production mode)
• display_errors: OFF
• session.cookie_httponly: ON
• session.cookie_secure: ON
• session.cookie_samesite: Strict
• mbstring.func_overload: OFF
• open_basedir: Enforced (4 paths locked)
• unserialize_max_depth: 64 (DoS protected)

Trade-offs accepted (with mitigation):
• allow_url_fopen = ON → required for Symfony HTTP Client / Stripe / reCAPTCHA
• file_uploads = ON → secured via ClamAV + MIME + metadata stripping + outside webroot

Full raw audit available internally only. This summary is generated automatically after every deploy.
